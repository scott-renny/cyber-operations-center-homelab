# Security Principles

# Purpose

This document defines the security principles that guide every design decision, technology selection, deployment, and operational process within the Cyber Operations Center Engineering Program.

Security is not treated as a single phase of the project. It is an architectural requirement that influences every component from initial planning through long-term operations.

---

# Security Objectives

The primary security objectives of this program are:

- Protect systems and data
- Reduce attack surface
- Detect malicious activity
- Respond quickly to security events
- Recover from failures
- Continuously improve the environment

Every technology introduced into the environment should strengthen one or more of these objectives.

---

# Engineering Principles

## Security by Design

Security requirements are considered before implementation.

Every new component should be evaluated for:

- Security impact
- Operational impact
- Integration requirements
- Monitoring requirements
- Recovery requirements

---

## Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of protection reduce the likelihood that a single failure results in compromise.

Examples include:

- Network segmentation
- Firewalls
- Endpoint protection
- Intrusion detection
- Log collection
- Access controls
- Threat intelligence
- Backup and recovery

No single security control is assumed to be sufficient.

---

## Zero Trust

Trust is never assumed.

Access should be granted based on:

- Identity
- Authentication
- Authorization
- Least privilege
- Continuous verification

Whenever practical, systems should validate requests instead of relying solely on network location.

---

## Least Privilege

Users, services, and applications should receive only the permissions required to perform their intended function.

Administrative privileges should be granted only when necessary and reviewed regularly.

---

## Secure Defaults

Whenever possible, default configurations should favor security over convenience.

Examples include:

- Disable unnecessary services
- Disable unused ports
- Remove unused accounts
- Require strong authentication
- Encrypt sensitive communications

---

## Observability

Every critical component should produce logs, metrics, or telemetry.

Visibility enables:

- Troubleshooting
- Threat detection
- Incident investigation
- Capacity planning
- Continuous improvement

Systems that cannot be monitored should be evaluated carefully before deployment.

---

## Automation

Manual processes increase the likelihood of configuration drift and human error.

Where appropriate, automation should be used for:

- Deployments
- Configuration
- Monitoring
- Alerting
- Backups
- Health checks
- Maintenance

Automation should improve consistency while maintaining appropriate human oversight.

---

## Documentation First

Infrastructure should never rely on undocumented knowledge.

Changes should be documented before they become operational standards.

Documentation should explain:

- Why a decision was made
- What was implemented
- How it was validated
- Lessons learned

---

## Continuous Validation

Security controls should be tested regularly.

Validation may include:

- Functional testing
- Detection testing
- Backup verification
- Recovery testing
- Purple team exercises
- Configuration reviews

Security controls should not be assumed to work without verification.

---

## Continuous Improvement

Every deployment provides opportunities to improve the environment.

Following significant changes or incidents, the project should review:

- What worked well
- What failed
- What can be improved
- Documentation updates
- Architectural improvements

---

# Security Decision Process

Before introducing a new technology or major configuration change, the following questions should be considered:

1. What problem does this solve?
2. What new risks does it introduce?
3. How will it be monitored?
4. How will it be maintained?
5. How will it be backed up?
6. How will it be documented?
7. How will it be validated?
8. Does it align with the project's architectural goals?

If these questions cannot be answered, implementation should be delayed until additional planning is completed.

---

# Guiding Philosophy

This project emphasizes building secure systems through careful engineering rather than simply deploying security tools.

Technology alone does not create security.

Security results from thoughtful architecture, disciplined implementation, continuous monitoring, thorough documentation, and a commitment to ongoing improvement.

These principles serve as the foundation for every phase of the Cyber Operations Center Engineering Program.
